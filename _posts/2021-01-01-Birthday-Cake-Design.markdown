<h1>Driving Through the Mountains</h1>

<p>
Here is a birthday cake design I made for one of my siblings.  The pixel art was drawn by my brother for a game called Treasures, which I designed and coded for the 11th Alakajam.  The Alakjam is a game development event where participants are challenged with creating a game in only two to three days.
