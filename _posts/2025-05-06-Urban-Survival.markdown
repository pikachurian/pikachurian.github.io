    Begging Doesn't always work. Some people will provide food, while others will reject the player.

        The spacebar is contextual and can be used to enter / exit the train, sleep on the chairs in the train, and beg.

    <li>
        The arrow keys and AD move the player character.
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>INFO</h2>

<p>
    This game was designed for my final CS101 project, creating a serious game. The purpose of this game is to bring awareness to the homeless people struggling to survive in the NYC subway system.

<p>
    While in a regular survival game, the player lives a Robinson Crusoe style fantasy, with the freedom to build shelters and grow food, URBAN SURVIVAL plays with the survival genre by moving the survival mechanics into an urban setting and limiting the player's agency, to create awareness for the struggle faced by the people living in NYC with no food or shelter.
