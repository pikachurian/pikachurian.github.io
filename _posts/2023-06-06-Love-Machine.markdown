<h2>Plot</h2>

<p>
The Love Machine, a giant robot warrior, pilot by six brave pilots, protects the galaxy from harm.  However, during one mission, one of the members, our protagonist's wife, is killed in battle.  This causes the team to disband.  Years later, our protagonist is living an unfulfilling life, still haunted by his lost loved one.  Though trouble still stirs in the galaxy, as monsters awaken from the oceans, when the time comes, will our protagonist be able to overcome these new challenges?  Maybe, with the help of his old team?

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
This is a short film I made with my siblings in 2023. I animated all of the 3D scenes and was the lead director and writer. The whole project ended up taking the entire summer.
</p>

<p>
The concept came to me when I was at a sushi restaurant and heard "Stop! In the Name of Love" play. Being a fan of mecha and classic R&B music I decided to combine the two.
</p>

<p>
The premise of the story was to create a more emotionally aware mecha show that explores what would happen if a member of the Power Rangers died.

<p>
Fun fact, the pose struck by the Love Machine robot in the thumbnail is inspired by the angel at the beginning of the Faust (1926) by Friedrich W. Murnau.
